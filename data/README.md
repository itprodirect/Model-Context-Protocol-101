# Sample Sales Dataset

This CSV contains dummy sales totals for a three-day period. It has two columns:

| Column | Description           |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| date   | ISO formatted date    |
| sales  | Daily sales amount USD|

Values are small so the file stays lightweight for testing.
